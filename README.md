# MVVMxCombine
MVVM using Combine

First created a simple app with MVC Architecture. Fetched a list of results from API and displayed in a UIVIew Controller.
Then created a new target for MVVM Architecture and performed the same task using MVVM.
Used Combine framework to add dependency injection and binding data to move it around between views and view models.
Learned about how to store data in subscriber(AnyCancellable) and pass it around through PassThroughSubjects and finally observe it using sink method
